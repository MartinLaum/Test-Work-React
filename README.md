# Test-Work React
Make a React app that consists of a form, a product grid, and a counter for products in your cart.
Through the form you can add products to the product grid. The form fields contain the product image (URL), name and price. After submitting the form, the product with the data specified in the form is added to the product grid.
One product consists of a picture, a name and a price, in addition to which the product must have an "add to cart" button and a grid remove button. Pressing the ungrid button deletes the corresponding product from the grid. When adding a product to the shopping cart, the number of products in the shopping cart must change accordingly.
The design must be done by yourself (Bootstrap, etc. should not be used).
# What I used
- NPM
- VS Code
# Installation
1. Download the repo files and place them in an empty folder.
2. Open terminal and `cd` into that specified folder.
3. Run `NPM install` then `NPM start`. If no error is present the instance should open a localhost page on your default browser.
4. In case of and error during step 3. Delete `package-lock.json` file and run `NPM install` then `NPM start`. This should be fast fix to get the profject working.
# Example URLs (assuming it's running on localhost)
http://localhost:3000/
